Arch Linux GPU Pass Trough Guide Tutorial Walk trough Step-By-Step   Keywords, easier to find on GitHub

You will Learn how to:
From scratch;  download and burn Arch Linux on a USB Thumb drive,
Install it, configure it and customize it the way **you want it**,
Then, we will install and set-up this Arch System for Hardware-Virtualization. For creating a so-called HVM (Hardware-Virtualized Machine)
That will I.e allow us to pass-trough the GPU from the real computer to the VM.
So you can play e.g Crysis (If your GPU is, good enough. I want to make that clear :)
In the VM.

I have tried playing VR in a HVM, with my GPU passed-trough and my VR equipment. Worked flawlessly.
Will create a tutorial like this for 2 other OS, too:)
[] Debian
[] Ubuntu
